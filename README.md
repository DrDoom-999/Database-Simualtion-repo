# Database-Simulation-repo

The project's goal is to simulate a database. 

The files will NOT create a real database. Instead, a database is simualted with
ArrayLists and Arrays. 
If you want to place data in some tables (small data packages) or you would like to learn more about databases, then try it out.

Edit: At the moment, once you created a table, it is not resizable anymore (at least when you want to add another column).
